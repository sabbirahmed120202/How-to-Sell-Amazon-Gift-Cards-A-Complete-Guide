Amazon gift cards are one of the most popular digital and physical gift cards worldwide. However, if you have an unused Amazon gift card, you might be looking for ways to convert it into cash or another form of value. Whether you received it as a gift or earned it through a rewards program, selling your Amazon gift card can be a smart move.

This guide will walk you through the best ways to sell Amazon gift cards safely and at the best rates.

Why Sell Amazon Gift Cards?

There are several reasons why you might want to sell your Amazon gift card:

You need cash instead of store credit – Amazon gift cards can only be used on Amazon, which may not be ideal if you need money for other expenses.

You prefer shopping elsewhere – If Amazon is not your preferred retailer, selling your gift card allows you to buy from other stores.

You received it as a gift but don’t need it – Instead of letting it go unused, you can trade it for something you value more.

You want to invest the funds elsewhere – Some people sell gift cards to invest the cash in business, savings, or other financial goals.
